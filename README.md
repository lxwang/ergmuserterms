ergmuserterms
=============

The purpose of the package is to allow additional ERGM terms to
be coded up by users (you!) and be used at native speeds with
statnet. So the suite of statnet packages can be extended with
minimal work by the user. In addition the core packages are
not altered and so the new packages benefit from improvements
to the core suite.
